    <div class="photo" data-text= "Interview, we here, a good first question would be – How are you? 
Alhamdullilah, nothing to complain about, alhamdullilah! 
One question that I wanted to ask that I genuinely don’t know…when did pollution first come about? Can you pinpoint the thought process to starting the brand? 
Around 2018, that was a weird time, with nothing going around clothes-wise, not like now with countless brands, all of the big brands started around that time – nobody in the UK putting alternative ideas into their clothes… it was all logo-mania, logo-based stuff, and it was just generic…from that time in 2018 I was doing tees then I took a pretty long break to come back in 2022 with all my people telling me to stay consistent

The idea behind the brand was just fashion as a very polluting industry, with the time that we were in 2018, with Trump and fake news all of that there was just a lot of misinformation in the world, pollution of ideas, air pollution, noise pollution, it has multiple meanings really. 
An ultimate point of pollution basically… I thought just on face value it was just air pollution, the stuff that people normally attach to the word… 
Its deeper, lemma give u another example yeah, have u ever noticed in the ends the betting shops, the off licenses, the chicken n chip shops, what they really try and do is put u on a lower footing when u begin, go to hampstead see what shops are there and compare that to here… mile end, stepney, newham, you’ll see the disparity in those places. 
Everyone knows theres a difference but its like the literal street is just different, it becomes a norm after a bit 
It becomes caadi, and it’s not, it’s wrong. A chicken burger is cheaper than a salad n a chicken burger has lettuce in it. Its heavy bro and you have to think about what you are being fed, nutrition wise, information wise.. 
When would you say that process of clocking on came about for you, because it is a mad process to just sit down and try to comprehend? 
I understand the game for what it is innit and authenticity never pays. It doesn’t pay, because if you are truly authentic, they’ll bring a bandwagon of hate onto u, people will mock you but if you try to fit into what people deem to be cool at the time then you got a lane or a business.. 
Then maybe you can be authentic later on 
Maybe. But the argument I’d have with you is that when you reach that certain point and have genuine influence over people.. How can you be authentic when there's gonna be people above you who are pulling the strings? So you have two choices. You fake it, make it and just accept that you're gonna have a lot of money, but you're never really going to shape the world, you know, in the way you want to shape it. Or you say, forget about that. I'm gonna just keep making the hardest stuff. You get it. And even if, you know, most people aren't buying it, because most people are sheep. You know, you just keep it going. And you just say, Cool, I don't really have a business. But you just firm it and have another revenue stream on the side such that you can explore those ideas. 
Crazy. So you can never really be an idealist for too long…at some point that will be extinguished? I would probably say that im a certain type of idealist…not fully because im attached to realism in the sense that I understand that the world works in a certain way but I can never sort of detach myself from that idealism and hope…but that is just the way I’ve been and to be honest I don’t want to cut that arm off because if you do you become a different person. And that authenticity doesn’t just apply to clothing does it? 
Like, you can find it any industry that you want to apply it to. Yeah, music, fashion. Any creative industry really. But I think in terms of the creative industry its all about the network you have around you. If you have the right co-sign from the right person, then things can just change for you overnight 
I guess I’m just starting to understand that now. That mode of thinking where if your clothes are hard enough people will start to tap in. if you keep making a certain quality then people will exponentially tap in and then your set. 
It’s the opposite. Your network matters a lot more than your designs. If you have tuff designs consistently like braindead or one of these brands… people will catch on eventually in due time… but in that interim period you are gonna struggle hard. 
And if you’re struggling then that where the passion goes. And then that consistency goes and consistency is all that really matters 
Exactly, exactly, for some people that consistency is easier because they have that network of support of people who are gonna buy/co-sign 
No question marks to who is gonna buy my shit 
Theres an acid test people have to conduct. In 10, 20 years, will a kid be happy to pick this out of a charity shop? When you ask yourself that question u realise that a lot of stuff being put out people just don’t care about which is sad, and that jus leads to that degradation and pollution problem cos these clothes are just gonna end up in a landfill 
No love attached to these clothes… 
None. 
So everything links back to pollution. So how crucial is a long-term plan that’s truly thought out… where’s the room for the unexpected in those plans for anyone who is putting something out there, how do you prepare for that unexpectedness? 
That’s the thing isn’t it. When you’ve been producing clothes you know how the process works, you know how to scale up. A lot of people that have decent ideas and a good network and their thing blows up, cool their thing has to scale up and they don’t know what to do – how to talk to factories. Producing at a smaller scale you get to know the intricacies, lead times, deposits, minimal order quantities, a lot of things that you generally learn plus you get to build a network of people you can produce with For me, If I was ever to blow up, I would know how to scale up, I know the steps, and how to grow in a sustainable way. It sounds mad, but I don’t want everyone to wear my stuff, for lots of people they want everyone to wear their stuff, to be a household name to be like nike…the biggest, and you have to ask yourself if that’s for you or not. For me that’s my worst nightmare, to be famous. I’d hate for people to know who I am and that’s why I cover my face. I don’t wanna be like a lot of these other people. For a lot of people, money is the motivation. For us, as Muslims it’s the belief that you are only here for a finite time. 3 things will come with us to the grave, but 2 things will go back…your family, your money will go back but the good deeds stay with you. 
So that’s where the contentment at. 
If money is your sole focus, then you can make a lot of money. But you can lose your morals the same way. 
That’s a lot of what I’m thinking about in my life right now. When you are young you are sheltered. When you step out into the world it’s like you have the independence, but no one is holding your hand anymore. You gotta do that shit yourself. And you gotta come to the realisation that you can’t do anything half-hearted --- 
That’s what one teacher told me. Do everything to the best of your ability because that is where the personal satisfaction is at. You do it to the best of your ability and no one can chat to you. 
You’ve talked about the origin of pollution as a brand but step back out of that …cos I guess everyone has a sort of awakening when they begin to fine tune whatever art, specific music, or clothes that they like, what was that process like for you? 
When I was younger, and I still am, I loved those streetwear brands or whatever you wanna call them… the Supreme, the Palaces, the Bape…I used to really love Bape back in 2012-14. I used to be just intrigued by clothes. It tells you a lot about a person and who they are and their interests. 
It’s a cliché that clothes show your personality isn’t it though because it’s not really true, I guess it is but it doesn’t show personality to me.
Maybe not personality as such. 
Someone could be wearing emo shit and be the happiest person in the world. 
I hear that but if you’re into the emo shit typically you’re into the music and the art… 
But then again, humans aren’t monolithic, you can like something and cross the boundary into just doing shit different. That’s the cool thing about any look to me.
I hear it but nobody can be truly original. They've appropriated from somewhere, but nobody can wear a fit and they can totally tell you the how they've originated that look 100%. And it's never come from another kind of civilization culture or something in history. Yeah, of course, history always repeats itself especially with clothes.
Chat to me about how identity drives pollution as a brand 
Everything is driven by identity. The England cap was for the World Cup. The Somali nationalist tee… that’s a joke and a lot of people just don’t get it. Nationalism is disgusting and people are quick to point it out when they see it on a tee but when they are practising it in everyday life its normal to them.
This is the mad thing to think about. There’s the people on one side who see nationalism and go what the fuck? But then there’s the other group who see the tee and go yo I kinda like this mans Somali lemme cop im gonna wear this everyday. And then you got the people that see the tee and their first reaction is to laugh because they instantly get it like when I first saw that I was laughing… 
It’s comedic. 
Its craziness in the sense that if you’re wearing somali nationalist every day you are gonna provoke something 
You see the brand FTP (Fuck The Population) the owner of that is really gnarly. He put the Columbine shootings on his tees… he’s put that on clothes. A lot of people say this that or the other, but people still buy that. You go on grailed and those tees are crazy money, and the reality is if you wear those tees I don’t buy someone is gonna do something to you. 
Ok physically maybe no, but its provocative in the sense it would provoke a real-life argument. You’re gonna get someone heated. 
Is it a problem that most clothes today don’t do that? Most clothes today don’t provoke anything, people go it’s a graphic tee…nice. Don’t you think it’s good that there’s something provoking, that push people to debate and push conversation 
It matters what your intention is first of all, and where the person who is putting it out is coming from. Provocation is alright at times but there’s a certain line… there’s different provocations, people might be provoking, in the sense of your tee, in a funny way, but then again people may be looking to provoke in a genuinely offensive way.. 
Of course. If you’re coming out on a mad offensive or racist angle if you’re really a gazi group of people, eventually you’ll get dealt with, can’t argue with that. 
But then again, eventually you’ll get dealt with but for a certain amount of time you’ll be the topic of conversation, and that’s what people aim for, that’s what they wanna go for. 
I think you have to remember that today attention is currency. If you have someone’s full attention that’s really a currency. 
Everything loops back to morals in a certain way. There’s good attention and there’s bad attention. Obviously good attention is the way to go and that’s the way you get people to tap in 
But then if you look at most of the people who are the people they’ve had a controversy. There are a couple cases that haven’t but most have. 
There’s a line with those controversies though, it’s mad interesting to think about certain controversies you can just sweep past but some you are just out and done. I guess that’s just society. 
Its profound. 
Imagine if morals were the currency. But that’s not how the world works. 
Not at all. 
Wish it did. In my ideal world that’s how it would be. 
I guess in everyone’s ideal world it would be a true meritocracy but we know that’s not how the world works. 
It’s not. You try and you try but 
Everything is based on the cards you’re dealt. 
I think that’s thinking about it in a very focused way. Generally, even in the education context, you try and you try but sometimes there’s nothing you can do.
That’s the whole point even the argument earlier … You try your best and whatever happens happens. That’s that. What else can you ask for? 
Something else that always matters is that you can’t be disheartened. Gotta have the heart to keep going… 
That’s all it is bro. you put your faith in God and keep going. Some people come to this country with nothing, cleaning pots and pans, and in 20-30 years got their own businesses and they are thriving. It's up to you what you want to do with the cards you are dealt. Everyone is dealt different cards. If you fail 99 times…you can be on your arse 99 times and all you need is to keep believing. That one moment when you stop believing that’s when you are screwed. All those times you fail there’s a lot of lessons in that. Anyone who is successful failed many times but the thing that you have to understand is that you have to fail to succeed. 
Good note to end on. 
Love my bro. I appreciate it.">
