    <div class="photo" data-text= "Interview, we here, a good first question would be – How are you? 
Alhamdullilah, nothing to complain about, alhamdullilah! 
One question that I wanted to ask that I genuinely don’t know…when did pollution first come about? Can you pinpoint the thought process to starting the brand? 
Around 2018, that was a weird time, with nothing going around clothes-wise, not like now with countless brands, all of the big brands started around that time – nobody in the UK putting alternative ideas into their clothes… it was all logo-mania, logo-based stuff, and it was just generic…from that time in 2018 I was doing tees then I took a pretty long break to come back in 2022 with all my people telling me to stay consistent

The idea behind the brand was just fashion as a very polluting industry, with the time that we were in 2018, with Trump and fake news all of that there was just a lot of misinformation in the world, pollution of ideas, air pollution, noise pollution, it has multiple meanings really. 
An ultimate point of pollution basically… I thought just on face value it was just air pollution, the stuff that people normally attach to the word… 
Its deeper, lemma give u another example yeah, have u ever noticed in the ends the betting shops, the off licenses, the chicken n chip shops, what they really try and do is put u on a lower footing when u begin, go to hampstead see what shops are there and compare that to here… mile end, stepney, newham, you’ll see the disparity in those places. 
Everyone knows theres a difference but its like the literal street is just different, it becomes a norm after a bit 
It becomes caadi, and it’s not, it’s wrong. A chicken burger is cheaper than a salad n a chicken burger has lettuce in it. Its heavy bro and you have to think about what you are being fed, nutrition wise, information wise.. 
When would you say that process of clocking on came about for you, because it is a mad process to just sit down and try to comprehend? 
I understand the game for what it is innit and authenticity never pays. It doesn’t pay, because if you are truly authentic, they’ll bring a bandwagon of hate onto u, people will mock you but if you try to fit into what people deem to be cool at the time then you got a lane or a business.. 
Then maybe you can be authentic later on 
Maybe. But the argument I’d have with you is that when you reach that certain point and have genuine influence over people.. How can you be authentic when there's gonna be people above you who are pulling the strings? So you have two choices. You fake it, make it and just accept that you're gonna have a lot of money, but you're never really going to shape the world, you know, in the way you want to shape it. Or you say, forget about that. I'm gonna just keep making the hardest stuff. You get it. And even if, you know, most people aren't buying it, because most people are sheep. You know, you just keep it going. And you just say, Cool, I don't really have a business. But you just firm it and have another revenue stream on the side such that you can explore those ideas. 
Crazy. So you can never really be an idealist for too long…at some point that will be extinguished? I would probably say that im a certain type of idealist…not fully because im attached to realism in the sense that I understand that the world works in a certain way but I can never sort of detach myself from that idealism and hope…but that is just the way I’ve been and to be honest I don’t want to cut that arm off because if you do you become a different person. And that authenticity doesn’t just apply to clothing does it? 
Like, you can find it any industry that you want to apply it to. Yeah, music, fashion. Any creative industry really. But I think in terms of the creative industry its all about the network you have around you. If you have the right co-sign from the right person, then things can just change for you overnight 
I guess I’m just starting to understand that now. That mode of thinking where if your clothes are hard enough people will start to tap in. if you keep making a certain quality then people will exponentially tap in and then your set. 
It’s the opposite. Your network matters a lot more than your designs. If you have tuff designs consistently like braindead or one of these brands… people will catch on eventually in due time… but in that interim period you are gonna struggle hard. 
And if you’re struggling then that where the passion goes. And then that consistency goes and consistency is all that really matters 
Exactly, exactly, for some people that consistency is easier because they have that network of support of people who are gonna buy/co-sign 
No question marks to who is gonna buy my shit 
Theres an acid test people have to conduct. In 10, 20 years, will a kid be happy to pick this out of a charity shop? When you ask yourself that question u realise that a lot of stuff being put out people just don’t care about which is sad, and that jus leads to that degradation and pollution problem cos these clothes are just gonna end up in a landfill 
No love attached to these clothes… 
None. 
So everything links back to pollution. So how crucial is a long-term plan that’s truly thought out… where’s the room for the unexpected in those plans for anyone who is putting something out there, how do you prepare for that unexpectedness? 
That’s the thing isn’t it. When you’ve been producing clothes you know how the process works, you know how to scale up. A lot of people that have decent ideas and a good network and their thing blows up, cool their thing has to scale up and they don’t know what to do – how to talk to factories. Producing at a smaller scale you get to know the intricacies, lead times, deposits, minimal order quantities, a lot of things that you generally learn plus you get to build a network of people you can produce with For me, If I was ever to blow up, I would know how to scale up, I know the steps, and how to grow in a sustainable way. It sounds mad, but I don’t want everyone to wear my stuff, for lots of people they want everyone to wear their stuff, to be a household name to be like nike…the biggest, and you have to ask yourself if that’s for you or not. For me that’s my worst nightmare, to be famous. I’d hate for people to know who I am and that’s why I cover my face. I don’t wanna be like a lot of these other people. For a lot of people, money is the motivation. For us, as Muslims it’s the belief that you are only here for a finite time. 3 things will come with us to the grave, but 2 things will go back…your family, your money will go back but the good deeds stay with you. 
So that’s where the contentment at. 
If money is your sole focus, then you can make a lot of money. But you can lose your morals the same way. 
That’s a lot of what I’m thinking about in my life right now. When you are young you are sheltered. When you step out into the world it’s like you have the independence, but no one is holding your hand anymore. You gotta do that shit yourself. And you gotta come to the realisation that you can’t do anything half-hearted --- 
That’s what one teacher told me. Do everything to the best of your ability because that is where the personal satisfaction is at. You do it to the best of your ability and no one can chat to you. 
You’ve talked about the origin of pollution as a brand but step back out of that …cos I guess everyone has a sort of awakening when they begin to fine tune whatever art, specific music, or clothes that they like, what was that process like for you? 
When I was younger, and I still am, I loved those streetwear brands or whatever you wanna call them… the Supreme, the Palaces, the Bape…I used to really love Bape back in 2012-14. I used to be just intrigued by clothes. It tells you a lot about a person and who they are and their interests. 
It’s a cliché that clothes show your personality isn’t it though because it’s not really true, I guess it is but it doesn’t show personality to me.
Maybe not personality as such. 
Someone could be wearing emo shit and be the happiest person in the world. 
I hear that but if you’re into the emo shit typically you’re into the music and the art… 
But then again, humans aren’t monolithic, you can like something and cross the boundary into just doing shit different. That’s the cool thing about any look to me.
I hear it but nobody can be truly original. They've appropriated from somewhere, but nobody can wear a fit and they can totally tell you the how they've originated that look 100%. And it's never come from another kind of civilization culture or something in history. Yeah, of course, history always repeats itself especially with clothes.
Chat to me about how identity drives pollution as a brand 
Everything is driven by identity. The England cap was for the World Cup. The Somali nationalist tee… that’s a joke and a lot of people just don’t get it. Nationalism is disgusting and people are quick to point it out when they see it on a tee but when they are practising it in everyday life its normal to them.
This is the mad thing to think about. There’s the people on one side who see nationalism and go what the fuck? But then there’s the other group who see the tee and go yo I kinda like this mans Somali lemme cop im gonna wear this everyday. And then you got the people that see the tee and their first reaction is to laugh because they instantly get it like when I first saw that I was laughing… 
It’s comedic. 
Its craziness in the sense that if you’re wearing somali nationalist every day you are gonna provoke something 
You see the brand FTP (Fuck The Population) the owner of that is really gnarly. He put the Columbine shootings on his tees… he’s put that on clothes. A lot of people say this that or the other, but people still buy that. You go on grailed and those tees are crazy money, and the reality is if you wear those tees I don’t buy someone is gonna do something to you. 
Ok physically maybe no, but its provocative in the sense it would provoke a real-life argument. You’re gonna get someone heated. 
Is it a problem that most clothes today don’t do that? Most clothes today don’t provoke anything, people go it’s a graphic tee…nice. Don’t you think it’s good that there’s something provoking, that push people to debate and push conversation 
It matters what your intention is first of all, and where the person who is putting it out is coming from. Provocation is alright at times but there’s a certain line… there’s different provocations, people might be provoking, in the sense of your tee, in a funny way, but then again people may be looking to provoke in a genuinely offensive way.. 
Of course. If you’re coming out on a mad offensive or racist angle if you’re really a gazi group of people, eventually you’ll get dealt with, can’t argue with that. 
But then again, eventually you’ll get dealt with but for a certain amount of time you’ll be the topic of conversation, and that’s what people aim for, that’s what they wanna go for. 
I think you have to remember that today attention is currency. If you have someone’s full attention that’s really a currency. 
Everything loops back to morals in a certain way. There’s good attention and there’s bad attention. Obviously good attention is the way to go and that’s the way you get people to tap in 
But then if you look at most of the people who are the people they’ve had a controversy. There are a couple cases that haven’t but most have. 
There’s a line with those controversies though, it’s mad interesting to think about certain controversies you can just sweep past but some you are just out and done. I guess that’s just society. 
Its profound. 
Imagine if morals were the currency. But that’s not how the world works. 
Not at all. 
Wish it did. In my ideal world that’s how it would be. 
I guess in everyone’s ideal world it would be a true meritocracy but we know that’s not how the world works. 
It’s not. You try and you try but 
Everything is based on the cards you’re dealt. 
I think that’s thinking about it in a very focused way. Generally, even in the education context, you try and you try but sometimes there’s nothing you can do.
That’s the whole point even the argument earlier … You try your best and whatever happens happens. That’s that. What else can you ask for? 
Something else that always matters is that you can’t be disheartened. Gotta have the heart to keep going… 
That’s all it is bro. you put your faith in God and keep going. Some people come to this country with nothing, cleaning pots and pans, and in 20-30 years got their own businesses and they are thriving. It's up to you what you want to do with the cards you are dealt. Everyone is dealt different cards. If you fail 99 times…you can be on your arse 99 times and all you need is to keep believing. That one moment when you stop believing that’s when you are screwed. All those times you fail there’s a lot of lessons in that. Anyone who is successful failed many times but the thing that you have to understand is that you have to fail to succeed. 
Good note to end on. 
Love my bro. I appreciate it." data-second-text="Mohamed is someone who understand how the unadulterated world works. The grounded nature that drives
his movements naturally envelops the work that goes into Pollution day in, day out. There’s a conscious move
that has been undertaken that moves clothes out of just clothes, out of just reproduction of materials or a
quick fix to profit. This is something that is underlined in the conversation above with the goalposts
conveniently moved to help me understand that such conscious decisions are not limited to any one lane or
venue. It’s a path that one commits to, to try above all else. We live in a world that for better or worse that ties
abstract success and our aspirations together. Perhaps, for some of us, those dreams will come to fruition just
how we thought, and everything will be as blessed as it was in our imagination. I’m starting to believe that
those dreams aren’t actually locked away in the ever-distant future, a time that we’ll just know right there and
then that we made it. Those hopes and dreams are carried with us as we lay the foundation, as we put in those
countless hours of hard work, as we mould the vision. Undeniably, the endgame is that goal we are all looking
for but that ball doesn’t hit the back of the net without having your head screwed on straight and putting your
all in when the moment comes. I’ll quit with the analogies, but you get my drift. It’s the struggles that make it
worth it, and the struggles that make that win in all its glory. Whatever happens, that struggle and that
conscious decision to try is the success that defines, and the success that nobody can ever take from you.">

    <div class="photo" data-text="I’m hopping into my greenery bag. Feels like I've missed the opportunity but still.
I wouldn’t think about it as something you’ve missed out on, you’re living it now!
    But I guess when you’re a kid it’s a bit more wow.
    Oh, I know trust me like my parents never used to let me out not until I showed myself to be a serious candidate schoolwise, in that sense I felt like I missed out on a lot, even on the simple stuff, everyone would be going to the chicken shop after school and I’d be there getting picked up straight away.
    But you’d be surprised how many people had that same sort of thing as well. My brother always used to be the one who wanted to stay out, when the clock hit 4.30 I was done, straight to home seeing that my school was only a few streets away – just to play some fifa or watch a couple movies before I had to do school all over again. I was stuck in that loop for a long time.
    That’s the age for it though that’s what you do.
    So what’s the diagnosis like 85% West London 15% South London?
    Obviously I’m a West London girl come on now but I've dipped my toes all around. Spent a lot of time in Harrow cos my brother and niece are there. Mill Hill cos my best friend is there, Finchley and Colindale cos of my cousins... South London of course, Clapham Junction, Wandsworth...
    See what my thing is, I do know a lot of London now just cos of being all over the place in recent years. But thinking about childhood, I literally never left South, and to even be more specific basically just South West. At that age, if someone made Wandsworth and Lambeth into a little island with no way to leave bro I would have been totally fine, that would’ve just been another day to me. For me it was all post lock-down that I started to actually step out and get to know London a bit more properly.
    
Still never been Hayes.
    Never ever been there.
    Wtf do they do in Hayes? Out there straight drinking blood and sacrificing animals. I still get that little wow factor when I&#39;m outside in places I am not at all familiar in. Especially in North and East to a certain extent, it’s the physical geography is insane to me. The roads are geniunely different, the street structure... Here is nice still, not a major difference apart from places like Bello...
    I’m glad I’m here. I'm glad the government placed me here.
    Couldn’t imagine being anywhere else. Crazy that one little split decision where your parents just get given a yard that could be absolutely anywhere in the city just totally and permanently forms so much of who you are.
    There’s something about Ladbroke Grove, man.
    Something about Wano, man. Everyone will say that about where they grew up but let’s be real Celine Dion can’t chat to Rihanna.
    I lived there for the whole lockdown from like March to August, a long time. My older cousin, literally the cousin who pretty much brought me up and introduced me to everything - drake, old school hip hop, rnb, make up - called me and asked if I wanted to stay with her and her family. It was a bittersweet time though cos my niece was born and we were like yo we didn’t even get to see her for the first 3 months of her life… but in terms of trajectory of life and all that I was just like I&#39;m about to start uni what is this?
    This is patmore right?
    Yes, exactly!
    Shoutout Patmore. Different stage of life back then.
    Looking back at the 18-year-old I was I was just positive like new chapter, great uni, proud of myself for getting there, and it just really changed my outlook on a lot of things
    And then flash forward to now, 2-3 years after...
    I started going out more, became more open to friendships, more open to myself honestly. I was so restricted to academia and what it taught me, but there is so much more to life.
    Like stepping out of a bubble.
    Exactly. And I definitely needed that cos I was way too focused on what would make my family happy, what grades I need to earn a high salary…nowadays it&#39;s more like who is around me… am I enjoying the day to day… what do I want my day to look like a year from now… what values do I have and where do I want to put them in my life?
    Much more introspective. Finding out who you actually are, who mina is…
    Still figuring it out.
    Who isn’t though? Nobody has everything absolutely patterned at this age. Ideally you are just meant to be learning everyday but we forget that.
    I don’t think I&#39;ve even made a step yet.
    You definitely have. Like 100 thousand percent you have. The way I like to think about it is that you just have to be on the right path, and everything will fall into place.
    It&#39;s like that stepping stone theory!
    I ain’t even heard of that, what’s that?
    Hold on, lemme find it.
  
    (Deep concentration and various google searches to no avail)
    You may have just made that up but that is hard. Try explain the concept how you understand it.
    So you’re taking steps everyday, but you can only see what is right ahead of you and you don’t realise that all of these steps are important. All these steps mean something to move you closer to that big, imagined place you are longing for, and you don’t quite realise it. You are more so worried about the step itself. Why am I here? Why am I wobbling?
    BUT SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO WOBBLE TO GET TO THE NEXT ONE. Making up theories that’s the new wave.
    I can&#39;t take credit...
    And that is a good abstract way to think about the future. Always nagging in your mind to make sure you’re doing what you are meant to be doing.
    But it feels real. Everyday I wake up and I&#39;m thinking about what is next in life. Like I actually just finished uni and I guess this is what they mean when they talk about post-grad depression, you end up working whatever part time job and you’re like what am I doing, I just did a whole ass degree, what is next?
    But that is literally a stepping stone in itself. Nothing is linear no matter how much you want it to be. For some, they’ll have that as in they are fresh out of uni, patterned a grad job in no time, and they are there locked straight into the next 5 years of their life.
    Classic story.
    You never know though you may hate that grad job more than anything there counting the days till payday.
    But the security is nice.
    So now outside of that fold of uni what&#39;s the immediate plan? Is it time to just bake for however long the baking life needs you?
    For the near future, chill for a bit... Go on holiday with my friends, take more photos, style my friends and work on a few more shoots, maybe do social media a bit more...
    And that is an avenue in itself I guess.
    But then again I&#39;m not exactly comfortable being online like that
    Because you have to subscribe to being online, as in putting your face out there, fully?
    Yeah, and I never was like that growing up. But now I&#39;m much more open to opportunities, meeting more people, and being online is the method to do that. I want to teach myself more about photography and learn how to develop film myself...
    Like actually be in the red room?
    Just understand the technicals way more. How can I be talking to one of my favourite photographers and he just goes ‘define composition for me then’ and I just went ummm... That was a real humble moment and right there realised I had to teach myself some shit.
    Only talking about Simon Wheatley who loves your shit.
    Moments like that make you realise that it is just the next stone. Putting ideas to paper.
    And now you are in a time where you are aligned to actually do it, you got the time, not thinking about uni, got the physical equipment and whatever, got to just step out and do it. And that’s a step that people gloss over but actually means everything to whatever you put out. Like even with Still Here as a project, I was gassed about the general idea, spent time planning it, numerous things that took my time somewhere else but the initial thinking was to make sure it was out there so I couldn’t go back on it whatever happened. Because then you would literally be doing yourself a disservice.
    Exactly. I was speaking to someone and they were like you are talented whether you acknowledge it or not, you are good at doing it and you owe it to yourself to go out there and deliver even with no end goal but because you simply enjoy it.
    I remember a friend once saying to someone, like repeating again and again to ‘just do it’. And it sounds funny because of the Nike slogan but they were bang on the money because that really is the most crucial of steps.
    And you look back at that as the craziest turning point because you made what some may call small steps and it changed everything. I&#39;m excited to look back but now it is just a matter of when.
    And you got a lot of different bags. Photography, styling...how did you get into styling?
    I&#39;ve always loved clothes. My mum is my biggest inspiration for that in a sense...one thing about Iranians is that they are always gonna show out, that’s all they wanna do
    If you had to describe Iranians then they just wanna show out.
    Literally just show out. Iranians will get what I mean. Every morning I would see my mum just get ready for work, doing her makeup, wearing such nice clothes. Also, I guess what I view online with the rise of TikTok, and seeing how people put looks together inspires me in the moment. The first ever styling thing I did was with my schoolfriend’s cousin, who does all round creative shit and shoots for fun and one day she just said yeah let&#39;s do it and it just started from there.
    From the outside, it seems like such a jigsaw. You got to have a mad eye for it. Straight up looking at a person and saying they will look good in this and that...
    That’s the whole thing with styling cos it&#39;s like styling yourself day to day is fun but it’s estricted. You can see a piece and love it but know that you couldn’t pull it off. But then when you are doing it for someone else, different sizes, different looks, there is so much creativity to that and so many avenues to go down and in the end just look amazing, that is where the fun is at. I do enjoy taking photos more...like that’s something I&#39;ve always done.
    What is it about taking pictures that speaks to you? It seems like a basic question, when you truly think about it, people have do have different elements that they are personally drawn to.
    For me, it is immortalising the moment. Making things permanent. A photographer, Daniel Arnold, said photography is the perfect magic trick for solving the problem of time. Seems so normal but when you look back at photos, you remember feelings, you remember the exact moment. I enjoy the process even if I&#39;m not the most knowledgeable on it.
    Really and truly, you don’t have to be. Not even just me bigging you up but you are hard. Some stuff is just natural.
    I asked someone who has done everything in the industry if they ever felt like they didn’t know what they were doing and they were saying they felt like that all the time, even in their work now. Crazy.
    End of the day, everyone is human. You don’t need to know every little detail. If you did, there would be nothing to learn and a life without learning, that is just bleak.
    See that’s the consequence of taking academia very seriously...it pushes you to memorise and try know everything, or as much as you possibly can.
    Sometimes that moment is just right. Fuck whether the lighting looks good or if the background makes it look hard, there’s just a feeling in that second that forces you to whip that camera out...you realise after a while there&#39;s certain stuff that you love to capture, for me, and I guess most people, it is your friends, huddled together or just standing somewhere random...that’s the shit that my kids are going to be seeing one day." data-second-text="
    The Stepping Stone Theory. Shoutout Mina for packing a whole lane of seemingly separate
    thoughts under one simple 4-worded umbrella. In my mind’s eye, the theory translates to
    those batshit crazy rock climbers that you see pulling themselves up the belly of the Andes
    with no harness, who only got the summit in mind. You could see it as just simply taking
    steps on the pavement or hopscotching a street to avoid puddles, it’s the images in your
    mind so you do your thing, go crazy...or not. But enough about what you are envisioning in
    your brain, I&#39;ll shelf my curiosity about that for now. What really matters, has stuck and will
    stick with me from this conversation, is the way I think about progress.
    What I am trying to get at is that, at least personally, progress is something that I don’t
    actively feel till I reach a certain milestone or complete something significant, a pitfall that
    all too often pushes you into thinking you are at level 1 of whatever you are doing. Once you
    change your scope of progress, you realise that every forthcoming stepping stone doesn’t
    have to be as dramatic as you may initially feel, and that crucially, you have completed too
    many of those so-called levels already. Shit, you may have completed basically the same
    task or challenge before and the fact it is presented differently or rooted in a new context
    shouldn’t phase you from getting rid of this one and moving onto the next. Progress isn’t
    something that you ever can fully conquer and the quite simple and somewhat daunting
    truth is that you are probably at level 797 of the progress game, a veteran hundreds of
    times over but there isn’t a level where you complete the game. No medals.
    Bettering yourself is probably one of the most continual things in life, and you know what,
    I&#39;m tryna climb that mountain again and again.">

    <div class="photo" data-text="With music you have to look inwards, and interrogate what’s inside.
    With music, it is unique. It’s very little pure craft, and craft is so much in service to the concept of what you’re making, the statement. I guess the only thing you have to practice is the strength and conviction of your worldview and perceptions… and that is something that is really really hard to teach or try to learn. A kind of radical self love.
    That’s a serious phrase.
    Super narcissism. [laughs]
    That idea that there’s like a specific type of narcissistic mould of person that can go out there and put music out?
    That’s genuinely true. Anyone can tell you that. Look at all those musicians out there in the world today… including me. Everyone has an extra sort of look-at-me quality to them. It’s not the same as talking loudly in a room, but there’s something…you want to be seen, or feel like you made it real in the world outside your head.
    Have to get into your own groove.
    You always have to be honest or you are not even making art. There has to be a core of honesty in it. But there’s a difference in what lengths you’ll go to. It’s very difficult to escape out of the genre of person you started out in, and what society expects from you, whether that be because of your background or what kind of story you have. But if you break those rules in service of being more true to yourself it’s possible that you can transcend it all a little bit. There’s that idea that if your material and core needs are taken care of in life, in that you have a roof over your head and enough to eat, your soul immediately just turns towards art. Anybody with the required amount of time to marinate an artistic idea, enough free time, it’s gonna come out. One way or another you are gonna have to take yourself seriously and decide you have a story worth telling, unless you never do and then…what then.
    And that’s sad as well cos everyone does. It’s mad thought provoking…the idea that the urge to create is ever-present…it just becomes a question of whether all that urge and will is listened to and harnessed.
    Yeah. I’ve been starting to put myself on a different timeline now. Starting young, it was like ‘Ok you’re that teenage pop guy’. That’s gone. It’s different now, I feel like I’ve framed myself as having to be more nuanced because I’ve taken this long with my work. With getting a bit older, you probably wanna grow to have a more heartfelt thing to say. You are processing your experiences, and you can break it down into strands and weave with a bit more complexity. I’ve been here this long and I feel like certain things that I have to say are quite eloquent. it is just so much thinking that isn’t necessarily needed but you just do it.
    But then on the flip side, that much thinking is so necessary because at least you’re in tune with yourself...and if you aren’t putting in the effort to think, I guess that is just a bit shallow.
    Yeah like, end of the day, I&#39;m working. The thinking is part of the work even if it doesn’t really lead you to certainty or victory or anything, you’re still bound to think because it&#39;s your heart on the line.
    Everyone wants to have an impact in the world. For some, they are so focused on the immediate – that their interests are so localised that they don’t ever really get around to the big world picture.
    There’s beauty in trying whether or not you know what it looks like. And ultimately, that’s kinda the romantic ideal, right, to throw something out there... saying something inarticulate, not so smart or composed, an almost childlike statement of self, like ‘I’ve been here’, to want to be recognised past your point of existence…
    I’m STILL HERE. No cap.
    Yeah, I’m still here. Really to just live past yourself a little bit. Ultimately, whatever I do, however personal my work is, my contribution is impersonal. To me it’s the whole world and everything in it, but when I finish it it’s given over and it’s whatever the listener makes of it. It would be very flattering for me if I was one of the bricks that people kept building on top of...I still don’t understand the relationship between music and legacy fully. I think I’m a human and other people are legends. I don’t relate, I feel smaller.
    Crazy. Lemme get another tarot card. Uhh...A knight with a spear of lavender on one horse that looks too powerful.
    [Reading off the tarot card] The Prince of Swords. Dreams have the opportunity to become solid reality now." data-second-text="This interview took place sometime in mid Sep, and I’ve had the joy to keep thinking about
    some of the things we touched on. Shoutout Leo. Shoutout cliches. I can’t help but being
    drawn back again and again to the idea that art is something totally natural to the human
    spirit. I just googled the definition of art and it’s telling me about ‘the expression or
    application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as
    painting or sculpture…’. Fuck that. Before you start thinking it, I’m not playing judge, jury
    and executioner on Wikipedia – I know it’s including all the conventional avenues in music,
    cinema, architecture, alladat. But I’m starting to understand that art is anything one makes,
    any conduit, to truly express themselves and say something to the world, an itch that is
    torturous if not scratched, a feeling that expands into thought and a thought that evolves
    into a landmine that you’ve stepped onto and are simply fucked if you don’t just do and
    jump off in time. Don’t be Steve Coogan in Tropic Thunder, be Jonathan Major’s CHARACTER
    in Da 5 Bloods. I repeat, his CHARACTER!!!! Not him, he can go suck out. Let me get back to
    the point – I guess I’m just trying to say that art is something that has no set goalposts, an
    infinite space for you to create whatever the hell you want. Nobody can define that shit but
    
    you and that’s what’s so strikingly beautiful about it – literally you, your replication of your
    world, for you – and if you choose, for the world. A never-ending cycle of service…
    There’s one word I gotta commend them Wikipedia man for putting in there and that’s
    ‘imagination’. It has been etched into my mind recently for better, or for worse, mainly
    because I’ve just started to realise something is diluting that part of my brain – and I really
    don’t know what it is. I refuse to believe it is a natural part of growing up. Maybe it’s me
    back to the uni lifestyle, right back into the fold of mundanity. Same white mocha and same
    train everyday…but that seems too anticlimactic. Pardon me for saying I need my diagnosis -
    if there is one at all – to be a tad more dramatic. Perhaps it has been my less than
    impressive output on this site, convincing myself I don’t have to be introspective all the
    time…Though even me obsessively searching for a core villainous reason in itself could be
    the source of it all, when I really think about it. Shit, I’m going back against the words I
    wrote 2 mins ago (Human – Rag’n’Bone Man) but the parameters of my internal discussion
    may have been doomed by the train of thought that led me to believe something had been
    permanently lost, that it was not a momentary, and crucially, fixable blip in something inside
    myself. Yeah man, maybe, just maybe…that’s it.
    For now though, the fogginess is ever so slowly dissipating to the cursed part it came from.
    I’m glad I wrote these words and dedicated time, albeit probably a bit too much, to that
    predicament. It was necessary. Scroll up man, they can’t say I never link back, they literally
    can’t say it. To be just that bit more serious though, I hope, no I IMPLORE you to protect
    your imagination (note - when being serious, use serious words), because really and truly in
    the hierarchy of things that need to be protected, it is up there, not number 1 or 2 but up
    there. Not Bolt, Not Blake, something like Justin Gatlin. Shoutout Justin Gatlin. We live in a
    world with a dire need to be reimagined, and man, that shit can start now.">
