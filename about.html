            Don’t ask me about my future because I don’t know. Certainty is a luxury that I can’t afford. I count myself lucky because I’m comfortable with the idea of hope. Everything in my life is changing and the only constant is love and community. For that and so much more, Alhamdulillah.
            
            Still Here is an interview series with the goal of immortalising the moment. An organised space only dedicated to the preservation of community, capturing thoughts and hopes through conversation.
            
            For a long time, I was stuck in a trap thinking about historical archives. The responsibilities of archivists - who quite literally decide what goes in, and more importantly what doesn’t, go into historical records. How many lives, how many communities, how many struggles and victories have been totally erased from history, never to be found again? Like I said, it’s a trap.
            
            But the wider premise still stands strong, and there’s an agency I want to reclaim with my memories. Now is the time to do it.
            
            I truly believe that London is on the precipice of something special. There’s a certain freshness ingrained within the people, an inexplicable feeling in the air that makes every day exciting.
            
            I’m also of the belief that this city isn’t one that is tied to the grand and the flashy – it isn’t tied to the shallow or the celebrity. It’s realm of trueness is tethered exclusively to the daily and personal, to the stories of perseverance that push you to keep going no matter what. I am naive, but not naive enough to define this city as a utopia when the better definition is real.
            
            All in all, I hope this serves as a reminder that there is something intricately beautiful about the everyday. It’s a nudge to myself to step back from the future and envelope myself in the present. To fully appreciate the moments shared with people, pure and simple – and to honour those moments.</p>
