        <h2>what is still here?</h2>
        <p>Still Here is an interview series with the goal of immortalizing the moment. An organised space
          only dedicated to the preservation of community. There’s no room for the abstract in an
          equation with people in the driving seat, with their thoughts and hopes as the fuel to the fire.
          For a long time, I was stuck in a trap thinking about historical archives. The responsibilities of
          archivists - who quite literally decide what goes in, and more importantly what doesn’t, go into
          historical records. How many lives, how many communities, how many struggles and victories
          have been totally erased from history, never to be found again? Like I said, it’s a trap. But the
          wider premise still stands strong, and there’s an agency I want to reclaim with my memories. Now is the time to do it.

          I truly believe that London is on the precipice of something special. There’s a certain freshness
          ingrained within the people, an inexplicable feeling in the air that makes every day exciting. I’m
          also of the belief that this city isn’t one that is tied to the grand and the flashy – it isn’t tied to the
          shallow or the celebrity. Its realm of trueness is tethered exclusively to the daily and personal, to
          the stories of perseverance that push you to keep going no matter what. I am naive, but not
          naive enough to define this city as a utopia when the better definition is real.
          All in all, I hope this serves as a reminder that there is something intricately beautiful about the
          everyday. It’s a nudge to myself to step back from worrying about the future and envelope
          myself in the present. To fully appreciate the moments shared with people, pure and simple –
          and to honour those moments.
          
          Alhamdulillah for the city, for the people, and for the dreams that grow closer every single day.</p>
